<!-- Exercise 7: Javascript Loops

For this exercise write three different loops that makes nine calls to console.log or use a document.write to output the following triangle:

#
##
###
####
#####
######
#######
########
#########

You can do this without knowing about the length property, but it may be useful to know that you can find the length of a string by writing .length after it.

let abc = "abc";  

console.log(abc.length); // â†’ 3

The reason to do this three times is to use a for loop, a while loop, and a do while loop. This will need to be three different sections of your Javascript code. This will help to see how of these loops function differently.  -->
