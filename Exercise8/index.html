<!--
Write a program that uses innerHTML or textContent to print all the numbers from 1 to 100 on a web page, with two exceptions. For numbers divisible by 3, print "FIZZ" instead of the number. For numbers divisible by 5 (and not 3), print "BUZZ" instead.

The HTML Page will have a button  on it. When the user presses the button it will trigger a function that prints all the numbers from 1 to 100 with the two exceptions listed above. You may add any other CSS that you would like to make the page interesting to view.

        do {
            userOutput += "<br>" + i;
            i++;
            }
        while (i <= 100);
        
        document.getElementById("example").innerHTML = userOutput;
