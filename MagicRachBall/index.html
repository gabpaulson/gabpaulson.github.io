<!--Fortune Teller Game / Magic 8 Ball Game

This an exercise where we will practice random number generation, form input, and conditionals.  

Trigger a function from a button
Generate a random number
Evaluate the random numbers with a conditional - you may use switch/case or If/else.
Return a prediction based on the random number

Description:
This will work similar to a Magic 8 Ball. The user should click a button that triggers a function. The function will generate at least 6 random options that will let the user know the answer to their question. The layout of the page requires a text input field, a submit button, and area to display output text for the user. Note that the input text field can be a dummy input field as it doesn't need to do anything. For this one  you can just upload the html file and the js file or link to your website. -->
