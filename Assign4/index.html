Part 1: Questions A (5 points)
What are the results and why?
a) var z;  alert(typeof z);
Results: Alert shows nothing in it, because the variable is not given a value.
b) alert(!!false);
Results: The !! evaluates false as false, and displays it in the alert
c) alert(7%2);
Results: The script finds the remainder of 7/2, and displays that in the alert
d) var name="Wanda"; alert(name+" Smith");
Result: Wanda Smith appears in the alert since the name variable equals Wanda and name variable is concatenated with Smith
e) var myNum="5"; alert(myNum+2);
Result: An alert appears showing 52. This is because the variable is 5 and the number becomes a string, and then 2 is concatenated to the 5 instead of added.

Part 2: Questions B (5 points)
~~~Describe a few important differences between Java and Javascript.
Java is to javascript as Ham is to Hamster, as Bee is to Beef, as Cat is to Catfish, and as Dog is to Dogwood. Java is for building software and applications, and javascript is a scripting language that runs in a browser to make web pages interactive.
~~~Explain the difference between the + and ++ operators in Javascript.
+ concatenates 
++ will add one (+1)
~~~What are the differences between using window.alert(), console.log(), and document.write() ?
window.alert() returns the results in an alert in the browser, 
console.log() returns the results in the console of the browser, and 
document.write() changes the html in the webpage html document
~~~Explain the differences between =, ==, and the === operators.
= is an assignment operator, can assign values to variables
== converts the variable values to the same type before performing comparison. This is called type coercion.
=== does not do any type conversion (coercion) and returns true only if both values and types are identical for the two variables being compared.
~~~Describe the differences between two types of loops: while and do while.
a while loop runs as long as the the condition is true, and 
do while loop runs once no matter what, and then runs if the condition is true

Part 3: Code Exercise (10 points)
a) Create a program that prompts a user for their first name. 
b) After the user has entered their name then have the program convert the user’s name to all upper case (this will require some research on your own).
c) Create an alert, or document.write(), that greets the user by using a loop to print their name 3 times in upper case, with 'Welcome' in front of their first or last name.
For example, if I used the program it would alert: 
“Welcome AUSTIN!"
“Welcome AUSTIN!"
“Welcome AUSTIN!"
