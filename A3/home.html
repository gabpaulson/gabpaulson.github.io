            <p>The summer of 2019 was spent in Gabon with my friend Maddie, and many others!</p>

            <p>Africa, particularly Central Africa is abundant in fresh fruit, but for meals, dishes are often carb- and meat-heavy. Fresh fish and chicken are commonly seen, in the wild and on your plate. Sometimes you get to try "bush meat" which is anything that is hunted and sold - monkey, toucan-like birds, pangolins, cat, crocodile, sea turtle... I was offered boa and antelope.</p>

                    <p>"Manioc" or cassava root, made into flour, fermented, wrapped in leaves, and boiled, has a flavored reminiscent of sourdough bread. It's served with most meals, often paried with a sauce or cassava leaf stew, "feuilles de manioc".</p>

                    <p>The peppers of Gabon are beloved and added to many meals, usually whole peppers added while a dish is cooking, or blended into a hot sauce.</p>

                    <p>Don't handle these peppers with your bare hands, especially while chopping. Our friend did this, and his hands burned excruciatingly for 5 hours.</p>

                <p>Our friends, the Otoungas, hosted us for three weeks, teaching us about the city of Makokou, connecting us with a <i>coiffeuse</i>, feeding us good food, and throwing dance parties. We miss them! Good thing for WhatsApp.</p>

                <p>We had much fun, during and between all the volunteering we did. One day we took a <i>pirogue</i>, or narrow, dugout canoe across the river.</p>
